Description:
This project features two counter modules. The main goal is to provide a clear and visual example of event handling and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.

Counter 1 & 2: Both counters have a "START HERE" button to begin counting and a "STOP HERE" button to halt the count. The counter is set to automatically stop when it reaches the number 50.

How To Use:
Access the project via the Live Demo link above.

Click the "START HERE" button in either module to begin the counter. The number will start incrementing from 0.

Click the "STOP HERE" button to pause the counter at its current number.

The counter will automatically stop and display an alert once it reaches 50.
